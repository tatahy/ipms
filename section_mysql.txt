mysql>help alter user

Syntax:
ALTER USER syntax for MySQL 5.7.6 and up:

The ALTER USER statement modifies MySQL accounts. It provides control
over account password expiration. As of MySQL 5.7.6, it also provides
control over authentication, SSL, and resource-limit properties, and
account locking and unlocking.

To use ALTER USER, you must have the global CREATE USER privilege or
the UPDATE privilege for the mysql database. When the read_only system
variable is enabled, ALTER USER additionally requires the SUPER
privilege.

An error occurs if you try to modify an account that does not exist.

*Note*: SET PASSWORD is deprecated as of MySQL 5.7.6 and will be removed in a future MySQL release. ALTER USER is now the preferred statement for assigning passwords.
